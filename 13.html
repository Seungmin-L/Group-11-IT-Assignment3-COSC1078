<p style="margin: 0cm; font-size:12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order for our project to develop further, I have been tasked to employ 4 people to deliver our project outcome. As the manager of the team it is my job to find 4 position descriptions that are suited for this project, in our case it is an affordable food delivery app which is going to be powered by an AI (Robot). The aim of our project is to create a food delivery app, to do so an “App Developer” is highly recommended or otherwise known as an Application Developer. The position description for an app developer is a computer software engineer, whose job involves them in testing, programming and creating applications for desktops, tablets and mobile devices. App development has risen throughout the years due to technology changes. Ideally for an app developer we require the applicant to have skills for when it comes to coding languages such as Java, Python, C, and JavaScript etc. We expect them to be able to understand coding and how to apply it to develop an app. Along with testing and fixing the app if there are an issues or errors that are preventing the app from working. This is crucial since our goal is to develop an app and it needs to be runnable along with free of bugs which is one of the responsibilities handed down to an app developer. As this is a team project we will require teamwork experience for an app developer, this is to get flow of work going and generate as many ideas as possible along with an employee that has a good eye for detail.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As our food delivery app is powered by an AI (Robot), the second position we want to take into account is “Robotics Programmer”. The robot will be in charge of delivering orders from the restaurants to the customers as quickly and as effectively as possible. The skills that are appropriate for a robotics programmer is being able to understand programming languages, for robotics we mainly use C or C++ and having good communication skills along with being able to work together as part of a team. The main role is to have the robotics programmer bring the robot to life and put it to work. In order for this to occur, we expect test performances to be conducted in order to show if it is capable of doing what it has been programmed to do. Along with have the skills to repair components and disassemble them when the resting phase comes into place. With testing we will test for the security and sturdiness to prevent theft. With a robotics programmer it is ideal that one is well-versed in mathematics especially algorithms, statistics and probability. Being able to solve problems and analytics will play a major role into the development of the AI. Development of computer software will also be required but collaborating with other developers is also good to speed up work.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having security breaches are common for mobile apps. There will always be hacker out there trying to steal information from businesses, organisations etc. To avoid hackers from stealing customers personal information having “Security software developer’ is absolutely required. The skills that we look for into a security software developer is there technical skills, teamwork, IT background knowledge and communication skills. Their main job is to identify and fix any security issues that exist or might happen in the future. We look for one that pays attention to detail and have knowledge about security threats. Having experience in cybersecurity field will provide a lot of help and reassures us. There is more to this job description than just identify security issues. Testing is one of the major skills that we also look for, such as a penetration tester where one tests it for vulnerabilities.  Depending on how bad security breaches are, we may require the developer to research and identify flaws so that they are avoided, along with assisting the ap developer with troubleshooting and bugs when they appear.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally  a software tester will be required to develop a software program for our users. We look for someone that has a bachelors degree in the field of computer science, software engineering or other related fields. Majority will be coming from computer science. We do not expect software testers to have writing code as their top skill but rather we look for ones with a good understanding and background in computer programming. Analytic skills are very important as they are developers, they must be able to analyse the user’s needs and then they are able to design a software that will fulfill that requirement. Interpersonal skill we value a lot as working in a team is very efficient and creates good environment. If one is unable to work with other then creating, designing and developing a software will prove many difficulties. Having problem solving skills are a must since the software developer is in charge of the software they created from the beginning. They must be able to resolve any issues and problems that occur during the design process. </span></p>
