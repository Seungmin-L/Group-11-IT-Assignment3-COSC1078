The reason for food delivery apps popularity has been revealed through various polls with 72% of consumers using food delivery apps because they don’t want to leave their house and another 42% use these apps to avoid bad weather (KASHANCHI, 2020). Also due to the current global pandemic which overcame the world many people have stayed isolated in the comfort of their own homes. This has contributed in the increase of the use of food delivery apps. These food apps have helped restaurants during this crisis as restaurants primarily depend on dine-in but due to COVID restrictions that option has been suspended, resulting in them being left with the delivery option. However, 64% of consumers are much more concerned about food contamination when ordering delivery from a restaurant (Kayalik, 2020). To avoid this, restaurants began to take extra health and safety measures to ensure that this is avoided whereas there hasn’t been much of an improvement with the health measures for deliverers themselves, making room for improvement. One of the few cons that comes with food delivery is consumers are subjected to fees when ordering through an online delivery service (Alexander, 2020), these fees are usually high with tests showing mark-ups on the food deliveries were 7 percent to 91 percent more than what you would pay if you bought the meal directly from the restaurant (Chen, 2020). All these factors equally contribute to the reasoning behind the development of the food delivery robot.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The food delivery robot will tackle all the problems current traditional food delivery services face. The robot itself will eliminate the risk of food contamination as there have been recorded instances of food delivery drivers eating customers foods and a poll showing 28% of food delivery drivers confessing to taking food from a delivery (Gilbert, 2020). The trust with the delivery drivers is just not there anymore especially during this global pandemic where instances like that could lead to life threatening situations. To ensure health and safety requirements are met the robot will be cleaned and sanitised after every order as well as the food having no human contact besides the restaurant worker and customer. The delivery fee for this robot service will be much lower than the current charges which customers face. Because this isn't a person delivering the food there is no need to reimburse the driver by increasing delivery fees, the food delivery company uber also says the fee is used for things like signing up new drivers as well as education and insurance costs. The robot runs on electricity and only requires attention for maintenance when needed making there no room for high fees.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the project idea was coming together, we faced dead-ends with trying to find a competitive app-developer as well as a reliable robot manufacturer. The competitive app developers were not in our team’s budget as they were expensive so finding a competitive developer was becoming a problem. Finding a reliable robot manufacturer which met the team's budget as well as having the correct certifications was hard as, as the price for the manufacturing decreased so did the correct certification and qualifications required for a reliable robot. These dead-ends could be resolved by increasing the team budget which is something which has been contemplated but at the moment it remains a dead-end.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The project idea needed improvements and points of difference in order to give a competitive advantage in the market. Although the idea was game changing there was already similar delivery robots out in the market. Many of these robots had similar features to the idea we had come up with taking away the uniqueness of the robot. Time and effort were put into the changing of the project to where the final points of differences to make the robot unique was concluded. Two new features were added to the robot which was also beneficial and further improved on some factors. The first new feature added was the NFC tap feature, this feature improved on the security, and efficiency. This improved on security as this tap cannot be duplicated and an NFC tap is designated to only one phone where compared to our old pin entry feature the pin can be inputted by anyone who gets a hold of it. It's also efficient as customers save much more time tapping their phone to retrieve their food compared to customers having to type a pin. Customers could accidentally type the incorrect pin several times making things frustrating and time consuming. The second feature which was added was the fast-wireless charging. Fast charging was essential as robots would be delivering orders all day so by having fast charging the robot can be up and ready quickly with a high battery percent for an order. The wireless charging was much needed as the robot is programmed to automatically take itself to the charging pad and charge itself. This would not be possible if the robot had to be plugged in to charge so by having wireless charging the robot can sit itself on the charging pad and charge.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To begin with, the robot will be issued out by restaurants where they will be provided with the robot and its wireless charging pad. The wireless charging pad is a flat pad where the robot will be programmed to sit on top of when its battery percent is running low, the robot can also be manually placed on the pad. The charging pad will be wireless fast charging with certainty of a long-lasting battery life, this is to ensure the robot will be able to carry out several orders in a day. How the food delivery will work is consumers will place an order on the mobile app to the restaurant where the restaurant will then proceed to prepare the order. Customers will be provided with an order status on the app going in the order of, Order made --&gt; Preparing Order --&gt; Delivering Order. When the restaurant has finished preparing the order, they will place the food inside the storage compartment of the robot and secure the door. Each robot will have a separate login ID so the order information from the app such as, the consumers name, address etc., can be transferred to the robot. The robot will have a navigation system which will aid the robot in delivering the food accurately to the correct address. The customer and the restaurant will be able to track the current position of the robot through the app. Once the robot has reached the destination the customer will be notified through the app that the robot is outside. To ensure security the customer will then have to do an NFC tap from their mobile phone, so they are the correct person. Once they have completed the NFC tap the door will then open and they will be able to collect their food from the robot. Once the door to the robot has been closed it will then navigate itself back to the home base, which is the restaurant it Is located at.    </span></p>
