To begin with, all orders customers make will be processed through a mobile application. The mobile application will be developed with the open source software Swift, this will be responsible for the development of the app. This software was chosen because it is one of the leading programming languages used by big companies such as Facebook and Uber. Also, Swift can be used for app developments for Android and IOS so people who own either can use the app. The delivery robot will have the GPS and LiDAR navigation system. The GPS will be responsible for helping the robot get to the destination by mapping out the route whereas the LiDAR instruments will be responsible for avoiding collisions and detecting obstructions ahead. The LiDAR instruments achieve this by transmitting and receiving data from hundreds of thousands of lasers pulses every second. The robot will then record and convert this information into a 3D representation of its surroundings (Bisen, 2020). By having this the robot will avoid collisions while on its journey. The robot will also come with a 360-degree camera sitting on the crown of the robot. The cameras will work with the LiDAR systems for a combined effort to “sense its surroundings with enough detail and precision to safely and swiftly guide the car to its destination” (Jobs, 2020). The 360-degree camera will also be responsible for the security aspect of the robot. If anything was to ever go wrong with the robot the cameras will be recording every time the robot is active on a journey and the recordings and information will be automatically sent to the cloud if there is a need for an investigation. On its journey the robot will be tracked through the app, this will be made possible with Vyncs GPS Tracker. Vyncs uses 4G wireless networks to transmit the robot's data to the mobile app (McLachlan, 2020). Customers will be able to track the robot's location while its travelling to deliver their order. To ensure security the robot will come with an NFC tap feature to where the customer will then tap their phone on the face of the robot and once completed the mouth of the robot will open so customers can collect their order. To add on to security the robot will come with a security alarm system in case there is a breach. The security system which will be used is the viper security system. If there happens to be a breach the robot will set off an alarm to aware surrounding people, the security system will then send an alert notification to the mobile app where details of the security breach such as the type of breach and location. The viper security system is fully accessible on your mobile phone with features such as disarming the alarm.&nbsp;</span></p>

He believed it was a good security system as he would know right away if his car has been breached because of the alert notification he received on his phone. He said it was also convenient that he didn’t have to leave where he was to get in range for his remote to work and disarm the alarm, he could disarm it right away from his phone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * GPS– Anthony and Seungmin have used a GPS multiple times to reach a certain destination. They both believe it is always accurate with its navigation as well as the estimated arrival times and Kilometre calculations.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Camera- Abdul and Andy have used a camera many times for film and photography. They say it captures the real world accurately as if it's being seen with the human eye. They use it a lot when on travels and want to capture moments to keep forever.  </span></p>
